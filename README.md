# UCARassignment

  Requirements from UCAR

	1. Parameterization can take the radius of a sphere and return its volume.
	2. Implement the parameterization in a language of your choice
	3. Expect the continuous introduction of new science features over the course of many years by many contributors
	4. Wide range of users: 
     a.) Those who want to use your software directly and interactively.
      b.) Those who want to incorporate your implementation in larger software packages
	5. Discuss the reasoning behind specific design choices.
	6. We expect to see your code on some version control site(s) (Git Hub, GitLab, bitbucket, etc.). 


  REQUIREMENTS

	1. Research and define the concept of Foo et al. parameterization (Optional)
	2. Make appropriate definition of top requirement #4 above
	3. Make a design such that the means of calculation of a sphere is made to be either more user friendly or more efficient in the use of time/space.
	   a.) Create a template function for running the calculation based on the use of any type of parameter(s) (this can instead be done by prompting for a string
         containing the appropriate input and then type casting it to the necessary date-type)
	   b.) Create other functions that will make different calculations based on a sphere
	4. Write the code that would perform the calculation reflecting requirements 2 and 3.
	5. Test and make changes to the code until the correct and satisfactory results are achieved.
	6. State in comments about the means of implementation
	7. Create a repository for the finished program and push the program into said repository.
